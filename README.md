Hi, I'm Nikita, an engineer who can listen to business and speak the same language with it. I work at the intersection of DevOps/SRE, product engineering and common sense. I've always worked only in product companies: I launched and developed internal IT, improved processes, monitored thousands of servers, woke up at night from calls from the "iron lady" and drunkenly raised servers at corporate parties.

I have thousands of solved problems behind me, from building pipelines to migrating infrastructures. I can easily switch between tasks without losing context (this is generally my trump card). I can manage a team, or I can not manage and do everything myself. I can write an application, or I can cut through ready-made solutions. I can automate where it hurts. I understand when it is necessary to optimize and when it is better not to touch. I can set up monitoring so that the "iron lady" on-call calls at night only when it's completely fucked up...

Write or call - always glad to meet you!
